So many red flags there. For one, he's biking on roads in the dark. I'd be terrified of my kid getting hit by a car, even with reflectors. Two, he's at the beach, surfing by himself. During a time where sharks are literally hunting and his vicinity is decreased. There's so many things that could go wrong with that. Not only is shark activity more, but it's a usual hunting and feeding time. So they're already on the look out for food and in that feeding mindset. I don't know. I'm proud of the kid. He's a little badass. But if I was his parents, I just couldn't take all these risks they're taking. Sure he's 13. But still. Maybe 15 or 16 I'd let my kid do that, but I still wouldn't have them in the water before and during sunrise. That's a recipe for disaster. His visibility is low plus shark activity is increased. And I come from a family of surfers. My dad grew up on an island and lived on the  beach, surfing every day. And now I live close to the beach. There's risks.

I think Alana is a very beautiful girl and a very talented surfer. She is a very nice person, friendly to her fans and everyone, and just generally a wonderful person. This post is about her attitude towards the WTC and taking PROFESSIONAL Surfing seriously. CLICK READ MORE...\n\n+Van Damage The Surfing community in general knows you\'re right. When she loses her spot on the WTC she will fade away from this 15 minutes of fame she is enjoying. Remember Kelly Slater did the whole ""Bay Watch"" thing for a year or two (he was also losing credability as a PRO surfer during that time too), but he finally realized he couldn\'t do both and become the WTC WORLD CHAMPION, he made the choice to be a 100% world class PROFESSIONAL Surfer and look what he accomplished, and Alana will have to make that choice soon or lose her spot on the WTC. I hope this is just a phase she is going through and she chooses to be a Professional Surfer soon. She has the potential to be a world champion if she would get focused. She bearly made it into the WTC for 2014 and if she keeps playing and doesn\'t start taking the WTC seriously she is going to get bumped off the tour by some of the WQS girls that are taking it VERY seriously.\n\nMaybe she really doesn\'t care about the WTC or the World Title. She is a silver spoon girl. She can just live the rich life without it or the wannabe modeling she does. I don\'t think she has the ambition to be a world champion at all. I don\'t see her ever being the WTC Womens World Champion if she continues trying to juggle so many balls at once.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I have nothing against her personally and love her surfing and her delightful personality. She is a great person. I once thought she would be a world champion but she has way to much going on to focus enough on the WTC and be a world champion at this time.\n\nP.S. Yes, I compaired her to Kelly Slater.

This depends on the size and exact location of the injury.\n\nLoss of spatial orientation is common in ear injuries, because the data that your brain uses for equilibrium (which way is up) comes from the inner ear.  Pressure changes or other injuries to the ear cause it to send ""corrupted data"" to the brain.  The brain itself is just a processor that turns sensory data into a conscious impression.  Scramble the data, and the brain has no idea which way is which or how to coordinate your movements.\n\nThere are several kinds of drowning that work via different mechanisms.  ""Dry drowning"" is when inhalation of water causes the larynx to spasm closed.  There may be little or no water in the lungs, but you cannot breathe because the trachea is blocked.   Typical ""wet"" drowning occurs when a large amount of water enters the lungs.  This will make it impossible to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.  \n\n""Secondary drowning"" is not due to seawater in your lungs and occurs hours or days after the initial incident.  It is due to lung injury that later results in a leakage of blood plasma into the lungs.  It is not and cannot be ""pumped out.""  Instead, the victim is usually placed on a ventilator to facilitate breathing until the lungs heal.  Most people can recover, but in the most severe cases the lungs are too stiff and inflamed to allow adequate oxygen / CO2 exchange even with a ventilator.  In that case, the victim will die.', 'You don\'t ""break"" an eardrum. You rupture it...', 'Water..even tiny amount gets mixed with oxygen trying to pass and feed into the alveioli which is responsible for feeding oxygen to the blood. This is why we breath...no oxygen and cells die  and brain also', ""He came back to life from CPR ????????? WHAT THA FUCK correct this please. Stop spreading disinformation, there is a responsibility attached to 1mil views .\nThe only way to restart a heart that stopped is with electric shock. Its not like in American movies.\nAnd you don't do chest compressions on someone when the heart is ok\n\nThis widely spread myth is killing people every day. Stop continue to spread this bullshit."", 'Its not that the eardrum breaks. Eardrums has nothing to do with balance. Its that  cold water cooling your vestibular system .\nIf you have a wet suit hood you can wait it out when diving. When the ear warms up the water inside the ear it gets better. \nif it break while surfing I guess there is little to do except getting help from friends', 'Secondary drawning happens due to the amount of salt in the lungs. It makes our lungs to produce water in an attempt to equilibrium it (like osmosys), then your lungs get all wet and we drown', 'At 2:20 (why nobody listens to me?) I been preaching this for years! OK Kelly just said ""cover your head"". That\'s good. Here\'s my advice for years, roll into a ball. Like a rolly polly bug. Arms covering your head, knees tucked into your chest. Stay in a ball until the violence subsides.

Naturally and. Casual. So. I mean wow,  just; wow.', ""The guy invented a Mae West - that's awesome"", ""The reason it did happen, it was because he had a helmet on. Like he said, it affects your senses and judgement. I used to be an ski instructor and the worst crashes was with people with helmets. Kids with helmets are the worst to teach and most dangerous. It affects their hearing, sense of balance, and vision.

I can't imagine being slammed by those giants.  Respect."", ""The helmet thing, I've ridden BMX hardcore, motocross  hardcore and was a pushy courier for 10 years. I hate helmets. They give a false sense of security that you allow your head to be hit. If you don't wear one you're far more aware of your head and, somehow, save it from the ground. Might just be me, but I won't wear one. I have an instinct to lay on my back and slide.

I\'ve been bodysurfing for over 45 years as a hobby. I only know one technique and that\'s the old style of Proning and I start by pushing off the bottom sand. As a Proner, I don\'t ride the curl but climb to the top of very large waves and propel forward with the momentum and ride the wave like a torpedo to the shore with some variation depending on the wave. I feel that I have every right to be on the big waves as long as the lifeguards don\'t have the red flag markers warning off swimmers, nor do the lifeguards ever give me warnings and directions. And usually it\'s not the big wave surfers that are the issue. They are a bit further out riding the big-boy waves. It\'s the novice to intermediate surfers. I often surrender waves to surfers if they are in the best position for the their sport. I duck to the bottom and stay out of their way on the way back out from shore. But typically surfers have no regard for bodysurfers even a bodysurfer as crafted as myself (I shit you not. Virtually overytime I\'m in the water I have strangers coming up to me asking how the f*ck I do what I do). My point, again, is I have every right to take a big beautiful wave that\'s either in my turn or for which I\'m in the best position for my sport. Yet these surfers toy with me verbally to get me off the waves and one has even yelled a couple of times about how I\'m ""gonna get hurt"". Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not concerned about their petty threats. But there have been several collisions. But I\'m going so damn fast our bumps hardly phase me. I try to communicate with them pre-wave but they\'re, of course, way too cool to even acknowledge me. Advice? Is there a rule for surfers regarding professional grade Bodysurfers on the waves?', 'Ok first snaking is when u knowingly drop in on someone not when u paddle around someone to get deeper. That’s called back paddling. And second there is no lineup nowadays, most just sit in the way and never go deep enough. I always paddle out to the deepest spot and go that’s the only rule! Closest to peek wins and get the f out of the way paddling out!', 'What beach is this?', 'in reality this never happens lol, too many snakes', 'Wow... This video is spot on with a lot of content, demonstrations, and examples... In my opinion, probably the top 3 relating to surf etiquette.... Trust me: SoCal (South OC/North SD Counties) loves that Barefoot Surf Travel created this : )', 'Great vid, and good rules to follow. But, Haha bet this doesn\'t apply to your local surf gangs, jussayin (yah I said ""gangs"").

Rule #8 especially.  You kooks, or beginners, need to hold on to your boards when the whitewater is heading towards them.  IF you are unable to hold on to your board, go to a place with smaller waves and learn how to handle your board properly.  Pisses me off when on some waist to head high day someone is ditching their board right in front of me. Just go to an empty spot on the beach and practice taking whitewater on the head for  awhile.

The biggest aerial or the most special one on a surfboard by far is andy irons. Helicopter height, 25 foot above the water with a solid double overhead to overhead wave below him with the xanax and cocaine redbull pot flow,  to land 31"" feet into the foam ball below without make just fist pump, Just him gripping the shit SO FUCKING high in the sky, extended almost SHIFTY and there was another one as Andy that day did it again, and the nose of the board aimed DOWN the same way a bodyboarder knows that if he sticks this landing Hubbard 2003-2007 style launch for aerial closeout BANG impacting the lip with perfection probably stoned or on meth or pain pills or simply DRUGS without a rotation rollo or gyroll I might as well snap my nose on my boogie on impact. I surfed and partied with andy several times on my life. Several, I never even spoke to him and if I did partying and he was around alone or in a group I was too coked out or drunk to remember. I remember surfing with andy twice from like 2pm till 8pm. Alone. Nobody out just me and him. Wave after wave.  On the deepest water and highest of faces shallowest beating faces.. Mad respect to all but without Andy Iron\'s airs none matter and if you can\'t find them, you were not supposed too as they were ads and advertisements for companies. I remember that aerial andy sent that shit to space. The same way people from my generation 1985 remember closely how was surfing evolving without andy this whole aerial shit wouldn\'t have been real. Andy also had mctwist. A low MCTWIST but andy irons had a mctwist or a cartwheel front flip backflip on a surfboard. JJF one time had a SOLID vertical aerial going right and I think they used it for an AD or a clothing company and it was a short or a caption of one of the young guns video or a surfing trunk. By far NOTHING achieves Andy\'s height. Nothing.  Super vert. 20ft plus coping paddle in, or tow-in, I don\'t remember I know it was fucking nuclear and Andy lengthy or stick figure body up there with the clouds as when the genera was evolving or changing pushing the limits. I flew one time too, like 25 feet above the water line as high as a coconut tree on a wedged closeout a winter I dedicated myself of going big, out of 2000 times you try an aerial one of them will change your life. Board flexed I hit the shit like 30 miles an hour perfect lip impact or POP on like a 12 foot wave easily, or maybe even like 14 and wedging or thicker in the direction that im about to impact, and people in the sand looked at ants and I almost landed on the beach saw the rolling white water underneath me super HIGH but elevated enough to see everything facing that way like half a mile of beach and concussive effects from the g-forces, like easily easy over 25 feet above the water including wave, 30 foot of air to make it worse barely 15 feet at most twenty like a two second swim distance to breaking my back or landing on the ground from how HIGH and the angle I took after flying, not flying to land on the wave but flying to go as high as you can, like in the old school days.  I flew that afternoon. I got pro status that year. Since then and andy\'s passing the whole evolution of surfing and bodyboarding has been lame, my generation kept it insane. Drugs xanax cocaine redbull. Pot. tons of pot 10 blunts between two people. Slow motion barrels high as fuck on weed. 2 xanax bars before the session, knowing what xanax does, as it puts you to sleep 2 will make you pass out,  4 bumps of a cocaine baggy to avoid passing out but get the sedative effect of the pill,  getting out to snort more cocaine if you feel sleepy, simply to wire you more with 20oz of redbull in the gut,  and if the cocaine is shit you might drown or pass out 2 entire days or people might think you are dead, simply fighting sleep with excellent give you a nosebleed cocaine, 2 grams of pot smoked before getting to the beach, smoking all morning, eating lunch or fast food, two three warmup waves, on 2 xanax 2mg pills recently swallowed like parking at the beach with 2 grams of bud recently smoked like in your lungs already and like half a blunt in the car for driving home blasting reggae music or metal or hardcore,, plus 5 bumps of cocaine before closing the car, solid ones or bringing the baggy with you and a whole 20 oz redbull finished, as there was no monster energy to a bottom turn to a nuclear aerial on piss warm ocean water to drink beer cheer fuck women raw dog, no condom leave make mothers, ignore pregnant woman calling, let them find a dad to that,, snort more cocaine and drink more liquor until the sun comes up only the best and biggest waves matter nobody as cool as us. Rest In peace andy irons. The rest are dreamers, or require protection and can\'t be like regular people, kelly is busy always with his dad and has a tony hawk life like places they have to take him n shit. Andy kept it SO fucking real like a homie, someone who might stay behind in the bar in landings in rincon puerto rico after all his friends leave or take a rental and surf alone somewhere else surf with me as a kid alone twice until the night time next to me, in SILENCE me and andy irons catching 50 fucking waves each, and probably score drugs in our own individual lives like regular people. I miss him. Shouldn\'t have ever passed away.

This can take 5 minutes or more of paddling, multiple duck dives ect....so, as soon as you're in position here comes that wave you were hoping to get. Well, you're not quite in the best place tho...so, you paddle like a mad man to move over to where you want to catch this wave.\n\nYou paddle again like crazy to catch it, and you're up on your feet.  Something is wrong, the wind is blowing up the face, you get hung up at the top and get launched. \nAfter a 20 ft. freefall, you bellyflop into the bottom and you know....hopefully your awake and didnt get any of that air knocked out as you go underwater. So now you're getting thrashed around a good bit and let's say you're held under for ONLY 35 seconds.\n\n35 seconds in a pool ...no problem for most but this is a nice relaxed situation. \n\nIf you really want to see if you could survive this situation first you have to get your heart rate and respiration rate up. Exert yourself to where your breathing has quickened, now take a half a good breath in , count the seconds.....35 ?

You have to breath hold train, you have to do various underwater training, you don't have to do max depth breath hold diving but you should be doing some basic dives dives like hunting down 45+ feet,. Hunting is a great way to train plus you get tasty treats like calico bass, white seabass, yellowtail, halibut, lobster, abalone etc. Some pool work with a partner is a great place tot start. Also get a big rock drop it in the water at your nearest swimming beach and there you go. Carry your rock walking along the bottom of a nice sandy beach you can do any depth you want from 10 foot deep to any depth you want.  I recommend wearing booties as if there are any reefs or fishermans hooks from surf fishing. Under water boxing is fun. Lots of things to do. I discovered mavericks in 1980 and started training 19 years old. Big waves at blacks or Rincon or other big surf up to maybe 20 is one thing.

I grew up in NJ, surfing Long Beach Island or where ever we road tripped to looking and searching for that perfect spot.. Every chance we had we would road trip over night to Cape Hatteras NC, one of the most magical special places on this planet! A watermans paradise.. My best memories of growing up surfing live in my mind of that place.. We could always find a secluded break 4 wheeling down the beach.. Surfing with dolphins in the crystal blue water, fishing for food with great success.. Its been 30 years ive lived in hawaii, coming here to chase the dream of those perfect waves... Lots of those here if you dont mind battling with 200 guys at every spot! The environment these folks talk about is what makes the magic, the perfect wave, the space to breath and become one with the energy.. The ocean is a church and surfing is more a religous practice than a sport if your doing it right😇.. You can hear all of these folks .ake reference to the spiritual effect surfing has had on there lives!! I miss you Crolina folks, you should know your blessed to be where you are surrounded and completely emersed in nature.. I pray progress hasnt paved over that blessed place.. My home in NJ is gone, Hawaii is quickly being taken over by the wealthy and greedy.. Aloha used to mean something, its an endangered practice now...Anyway I used to shape boards in my cellar in Nj and bring them to the WRV factory in NC to be glassed and get tips from Bill Fuller, Mr. Frierson, Lynn Shell and more.. Great group of guys.. I am getting older now 53, and still those beaches call to me in my dreams!

Seems hand placement is still a mystery. It’s one of the most subjective things about a pop up. My whole life everyone’s been telling me what’s the best way, though it really is just personal preference. Thanks mate!', 'The hand position are a result of how much angle the board is started on and how down the line they want there take off to be. Backhand will always have more angle in the take off on smaller waves to give drive down the line and time to get ahead of the wave, forehand is a little easier to drive with the first pump from take off. \n\nInteresting to see Kelly virtually go both knees up at the same time with everyone else really moving back foot forward first', ""That would have been more intetesting with bigger waves as your board might be less horizontal.\nBtw, take off is the most important part of the wave, if your front foot  is not correctly placed, you're dead."", 'Awesome video!

I actually love to see takeoffs in surf movies', ""this is pointless. You alter the way you get up depending on what you want to do following getting up, this has to do with the line you want to take and where you are on the wave and how you're weight's distributed as the wave starts to lift you as you're starting to move with the wave. Interesting to look at though."", 'Dude, thanks for that!', 'It looks like Kelly is doing a sun salutation yoga move on his pop-up.

Paddling hard so your board keeps it's momentum is also a good thing just before you make the decision to get up. Thickness of board and wave conditions also dictate how a surfer will stand up on his or her board. I can't believe I'm writing this comment"", ""This is sooo helpful.\n\nMost videos on popping up show all kinds of weird and different things that, after seeing this, aren't what the pros do at all and just make it more confusing. \n\nSo good to see how they do it to have something actually useful and good to emulate and try to work toward."", 'Thanks for the video! You could do one about bottom turns. What do you think? :)', 'we also have to look at the fact that different types of waves require different techniques in all approaches', ""As I age, I've noticed my pop up suffer the most. I used to surf almost every day and then family and a real job took more priority. As we age, we need to be more diligent about training so when we DO get a chance to go we're not floundering. I blow waves these days because I've lost that youthful snap. It's heart wrenching, really. Once I'm up, I'm golden but the pop needs work...\n Nice video but one thing I don't think you're taking into consideration is the different builds everyone has which may have something to do with they're preferred pop up."", 'This is a fantastic video.

If you correct this mistake, you'll see a HUGE improvement in your pop ups."", 'It seems as if here are commonality between at least half of these surfers:\n\n1) back foot lands first, sometimes well before the front.  and that foot is used to help push the front foot thru (even on Slater, if you look closely, his back foot still lands 1st).\n2) hips twist to raise inside/rear hip\n3) front hand (same side as the front foot) is usually well ahead of the ""back"" hand, and both hands seem canted in the same direction toward the inside of the board giving more room to swing the front foot through (eg, hands facing more left for goofie riders).\n4) head/eyes facing down the line in direction they want to go\n5) back arches and chest raises before the push on the hands\n6) hands on board until both feet are placed, \n7) stay low and crouched until that hands leave the board.\n\ni\'ve thought a lot about this vid, and these takeaways have helped my pop-up immensely!  it is not so much of a pop-up, but a quick powerful step up , and realizing that allowed me to keep in contact with my board, staying low and to be in the surf position once i remove my hands from the board.  at least this is how it works for me.\n\nthanks Brent!', 'im a goofy how can i reverse this video so i can see some left breaks..', 'Love this content, nice work.

I seems to me that for many of the surfers, the inside arm carries most of the weight, helping the body to turn toward the wave.', 'After surfing for a lot of years, my pop up on the shortboard still stinks.  There is very little video of popping up out there, so this is a very unique and valuable video.  Thanks for sharing!', 'great info, much ignored and underappreciated stuff.

Ya know how so many people are ""resisting"" Trump these days? My main focuses these days are improving my fitness for surfing (very important part of the pop up) and resisting the onslaught of the #METOO movement. Thanks though, for this otherwise awesome posting.', 'Great video, thanks for posting. There is a common assumption in surfing that the ""proper"" pop up is one where both feet land precisely at the same time. It makes intuitive sense as it minimizes wobble, and prevents any loss in speed. But naturally I\'ve gravitated towards back foot landing on the traction pad earlier than front foot, especially when surfing backside. Great to see it\'s a legitimate way to do it, as it works fine for some of the best in the world.', ""I notice that all of these riders kick while paddling.

I've been surfing for 40+ years and recently suffered a back injury that is forcing me to re-learn the basics. Frustrating as hell, but I simply refuse to quit-- or go SUP. Since I can no longer get away with anything other than excellent technique, videos like this are incredibly helpful."", ""Great Video! Thanks! The pop-up is probably the most important part of surfing in my opinion, since it sets everything else up.  I was surprised to see how often the front knee hits, or almost hits, the chest.  I would like to know more about the action of the knees.  For example, it seems that in at least some of the segments, the pop-up begins with the knees, which help push the hips off the board.  This is hard to see and I'm wondering what others think."", 'Good stuff. Very appreciated.', 'I had a plan to make a video like this. You did it much better than I would have imagine. The pop up is super important. Thank so much', ""Awesome video, I'm always watching the pop up in the clips, assuming they show it in the shot. They all seem to be a couple inches further towards the nose than most people are comfortable with but there's also probably more rocker in these boards than the normal board in the lineup. Either way, great to watch in slo-mo. Bottom line here appears to be weight forward, head down, angle yourself down the line and dont grab the rails, hand plants on the deck. Thanks again, great video!"", 'kooks!', ""Hey   Brent, great footage, back when i was younger, i didn't really think much about my pop up, just sorta happened, now that I am a bit older...and a bit heavier, my pop ups don't always come so easy, my hand placement was always more forward before, but now im going over the handelbars more often. these clips really emphasize getting your hands almost down to the waist, not natural for me...so im practicing... re learning how to do it right LOL"", '2:57 his feet did net hit the same time at all', 'Very helpful, thanks!

Why would you want to tell some one to lift both of their feet off of the board while pushing the board literally away from you while trying trying to get to their feet? If you are holding the rails of the board and using either the left or the right foot to anchor your self to the board you will have a three point contact with the board. As you rise to to your feet pulling the board into to you while either rear foot pushing down will vastly control your balance on the board. Sliding the unanchored foot forward and PULLING the board into you in one constant movement the whole process is quickened and made more stable. The idea of pushing the board down then hopping in the air with NO foot contact at all on the board means that there is a point where there is no tension between the surfer and board. If you just stop and think about it  the so called pop up is wrong. You have NO control of the board if you are not holding firmly on to the board. You run a major risk of either hand slipping to one side or the other which will positively cause the board to get out from underneath you or open your nose and face up to a potential for them to slam into the deck of the board. Why would you want to have NO contact with the board as you hop with both feet disconnected from the stability of the board.

Which first of all is losing too much of the wave's energy to the circle continuously stretching as it expands and travels away from center. And secondly, it is also losing too much energy,  due to only utilizing 4 short divisions of the circle for rideable wave. Too much energy is being lost to the 4 corners, between the 4 spots. Thirdly, waves that are bending out at the shoulders, usually are drawing too much energy away from the pocket of the wave, resulting in a slower weaker quickly dissipating wave, per given energy source. So I see it as not getting enough quality, size, and length of wave for the amount of expense and energy used to produce it.\nIt's just not in the same league as Kelly's wave. Kelly's is a long, powerful, properly peeling wave, with different sections of different wave types and features, all connected into one very long wave that is actually technicaly advanced and very challenging to ride properly. As we have seen with the current world's best surfers getting schooled by their own short comings, but then working it out and laying down some amazing fortitude and masterful performances on a massive scale, conquering themselves and the challenge of each wave n the process. And every wave in Kelly's pool is not the same. Which I thoughti, would be, to the point of boringness, but oh no, far from it, although I'm not exactly sure how it happens, but I have some theories. And then there is much more at stake with Kelly's wave. If you blow it somewhere along the line of these long waves, it's greater shame to watch your chance at an epic wave go unridden, especially if you lose the ride in the beginning.

Breeds like the great white are powerful and dominant. They are extremely territorial but only eat a few times a week. When you are surrounded by sharks, instead of just one, your odds become worse. Breeds like a bull shark however, are always dangerous. There is something genetically coded where they have to touch every surface of an object near them. Unfortunately, a sharks curiosity bite, can be fatal and if they sense blood and are hungry, it’s just a finishing position now. \n\nOne of the clues we had about sharks was when the titanic sank. The waters were soo cold that only a few species of shark were even around the waters and hunting. Cold waters work well for great white sharks but they also move continuously. They can cover hundreds of miles and never stay around one area long. Bull sharks and tiger sharks are your greatest threat of death. \n\nWhen the USS Indianapolis sank, around 400 sailors were eaten by sharks. In the middle of an ocean, you have hundreds of sharks in pods, not just one or two. Sometimes, the lesser dangerous sharks swim by the thousands within 40 feet of the surface, you just can’t see them. So 900 sailors went in to the water and only 500 made it out. There were no other water factors that led to those deaths. \n\nSo when you surf, it’s completely different. Now they see a larger object like a seal with arms out to the sides like their flippers and they see splashing which attracts their sensory of injured animals or fish.  That’s why surfers become a target.']"

So what I did 2 years ago as I thought of everyone I knew and loved dying and leaving me alone in this world and what I'd do about it. My mom, dad, brother, best friend, all gone, and I was able to cry for a good minute or 2. I don't know if how that made me feel buy now my chest feels heavy all the time and I think it is because of all the feeling I am holding on to and never letting go off, it actually hurts sometimes. I have tried again recently to make my self cry but it didn't work. I feel bad for making his sad moment of his mother dying and his dad being a huskless mass of human flesh but it made me think of what I will most likely become. I seem like I'm the happiest human being alive when I'm not around people but I spend a chunk of my time just listening to depressing music hoping to feel something, hoping something will click, but nothing most of the time. If I do feel something is on the verge of crying but I can't cry and just say on the edge and I would much rather let it all out than to stay there. My friends say they wish they could be like me because of how little I care, the ones I've briefly explained this to of course but I don't think they would. Of course, I'm nowhere near as bad as his dad because I feel happy but still whenever I'm and just quiet in a different person in my own mind that no one knows or will ever meet because I don't want my friends or family to ever feel sorry for me, they have their own problems. When he said that his dad drank to feel at least something I genuinely thought about when I'm older doing that. Then also what doesn't help is that there is a part of me that tells me whenever I feel like something is hard or I feel like telling someone about a problem I have like I'm a weak baby. I exercise so much and am so strong that people started calling me steroid man as a joke and a part of me that just beats me up and tells me I'm weak. I tell my self my problems don't matter all the time and that I need to make sure everyone feel go and ok, and that how I feel doesn't matter. I am depressed 50% of the time, fortunately for me, id never commit suicide or anything because of the people it would hurt.\nwell, I think that's enough typing for today for a comment that most like will just be covered up by the 1000s of others.

A shark!\n\nOof', 'only one squirt did it', '""And Batman came in second!""', 'I feel I must give a brief synopsis of what exactly led up to this madness. For context.\n\nBasically, there was a surfing contest at Gotham Point, and the Joker wanted to win. Thus, he went to get a new gang and intimidate most of the competitors into dropping out. At the start of the episode, he kidnaps Hot Dog Harrigan, a former ace surfer who now runs a restaurant/hangout on the beach, and sets up shop in the private rooms. He then lures Skip Parker, the best and most experienced surfer and defending champion, into a trap and plugs him into his Surfing Experience and Ability Transferometor and Vigor Reverser, which transfers all of Skip\'s abilities to the Joker, and attempts to hide him.\n\nUnfortunately for the Clown Prince of Crime, Skip had invited Barbara Gordon to the beach that day. Suspicious, she calls her father, prompting Batman and Robin to investigate while Commissioner Gordon and Chief O\'Hara go undercover as beach bums. The Dynamic Duo ultimately uncover the Joker\'s plot and save Skip, but the contest is about to start - however, as the Joker is the only entrant, he\'d be instantly declared winner. Luckily, Bruce Wayne has a major hand in running the contest, so he has Robin, as Dick Grayson, represent him in entering Batman into the contest. Thus...this.\n\nNow, you may have one big question. ""Why does the Joker do all this to win a surfing contest?"" Well, let\'s go through his perfect logic. Like every other villain on this show, he wants to pillage Gotham City. However, the small gangs he usually uses aren\'t working. Thus, the most logical solution is to win the surfing contest. That will make him king of the surf, and naturally everyone who regulars the beach will do whatever the king of the surf wants. Therefore, if Joker wins the contest, the entire Gotham Point community will help him take over Gotham.\n\nI can\'t come up with a good way to end this comment since there\'s no good way to follow up a marvel like this. All I\'ll say is that, while the show as a whole is hilariously corny, this particular episode takes it to a lovably insane extreme.', 'LOL!!! 😂😂😂😂.

I think he does keep himself relaxed and bides his time until he feels the time is right to make a swim for it. I suspect initially he's waiting for a wave to push him closer in order to be close enough to swim the rest. But the under current keeps pulling him back in. Where in his head is he thinking of getting out? At what looks to be the safest place, the steps. Unfortunately it is a very small exit point difficult to achieve given the circumstances (in the end gets out via the rocks instead). He also ducks under strong wave breakers instinctively thinking that they could smash him into rocks rather than help him get out.
